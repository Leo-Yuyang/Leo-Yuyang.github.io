        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>I am an Algorithm Researcher at Megvii Research. My research areas include computer vision and deep learning.</p>
          <p>I have a broad and strong interest in artificial intelligence and algorithm research. During my undergraduate studies, while maintaining excellent academic performance, I participated in multiple algorithm engineer internships at top internet companies and worked as a research assistant in Tsinghua university's computer vision laboratory for a year. In the 2022 autumn recruitment, I received several algorithm offers from top internet companies, including NLP and CV offers. In China, people use the term "Doom of the Gods" to describe the extremely intense competition for algorithm positions during autumn recruitment, and many companies consider a master's degree as a basic requirement for becoming an algorithm engineer. However, I broke the norm and obtained several algorithm offers with my rich algorithm experience and excellent coding skills, including some sp offers and ssp offers. After graduation, I chose to join Megvii Research as a Computer Vision algorithm researcher. At the time, I was the youngest employee on the team and the only one who had only obtained a Bachelor's degree.</p>

          <p>Megvii operates the world’s largest computer vision research institute.Our research team has developed advanced algorithms that have laid the foundation for many of the world's cutting-edge AI applications.Megvii is one of the few companies in the world with a proprietary deep learning framework. MegEngine was officially made open source in 2020.</p>
          <p>At Megvii Research, my job is to participate in the development of advanced AI algorithm production systems - AI Service. With years of deep experience in computer vision, Megvii has accumulated a wealth of industry knowledge. From this experience, we abstracted the entire pipeline of algorithm production and attempted to standardize each step.</p>
          <p>To this end, we have launched the AI Service (AIS), an AI infrastructure designed to adapt to algorithm mass production. Based on the Megvii Brain++ system, AIS has built a zero-code, automated productivity tool platform that covers the entire algorithm production chain, including data processing, model training, performance analysis and tuning, inference deployment testing, and more. This platform allows practitioners without algorithm-related knowledge to independently complete algorithm production and iterative optimization tasks. AIS marks another leap forward for Megvii, making algorithm mass production a reality. Currently, the AIS platform can support over 100 types of business model training, with training completion possible in as little as 2 hours, and model accuracy metrics far surpassing the industry average.</p>
          <p>In addition to the development of the above system, I am also responsible for the research work on fast labeling algorithms. Specifically, for classification annotation, we use CLIP to extract image features. After a small amount of data is annotated, we compare the similarity of the clip features between the annotated and unannotated images, and then automatically label the unannotated images. For incorrectly labeled images, we use reinforcement learning methods to adjust the image features to improve the accuracy of intelligent annotation. This intelligent annotation method reduces labeling costs by 70%. For segmentation tasks, we have developed an advanced interactive segmentation algorithm based on VIT. With just a few clicks, annotators can complete the segmentation annotation of an object. Using traditional segmentation annotation methods, labeling an image with dense targets could take an hour, while our method only takes a minute.</p>

          <p><b>github repo:</b><a href="https://github.com/Leo-Yuyang/Multimodal_YOLOv5">https://github.com/Leo-Yuyang/Multimodal_YOLOv5</a></p>
          <p>During my time as a Research Assistant at the State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy and the School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University, I contributed to the publication of a paper:"OpenMPD: An Open Multimodal Perception Dataset for Autonomous Driving" (although not listed as an author due to the large team size), which can be accessed at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9682587. I actively participated in the sampling and annotation of 15K keyframes from clips, involving tasks of 2D/3D object detections,and 2D semantic segmentation. Additionally, I conducted extensive experiments on the OpenMPD dataset, evaluating and benchmarking algorithms for 2D/3D detection and segmentation. This research experience at a top-tier laboratory has further honed my skills and deepened my understanding of advanced perception algorithms in the field of computer vision.</p>
          <p>Additionally,a method was proposed to focus on fusing thermal and RGB images for object detection algorithms in my graduation thesis. The insight was that each type of image carries unique information. For example, under high visibility conditions, RGB images may contain more useful features, while thermal images may be more beneficial in low-light environments. An architecture was designed by modifying the input branch of the YOLOv5s baseline. The modified network enabled simultaneous processing of both RGB and thermal images. Feature alignment and fusion methods, such as PLARD and deformable convolution, were employed with a branch included to classify images as daytime or nighttime to assist with training.The proposed Multimodel_YOLOv5 outperforms YOLOv5 with an absolute gain of 1.2 in terms of mAP and 3.0 in terms of average precision.Finally, my thesis was awarded the honor of Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis,and I gained hands-on experience with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.</p>
