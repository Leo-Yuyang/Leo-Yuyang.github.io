        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>I am an Algorithm Researcher at Megvii Research. My research areas include computer vision and deep learning.</p>
          <p>I have a broad and strong interest in artificial intelligence and algorithm research. During my undergraduate studies, while maintaining excellent academic performance, I participated in multiple algorithm engineer internships at top internet companies and worked as a research assistant in Tsinghua university's computer vision laboratory for a year. In the 2022 autumn recruitment, I received several algorithm offers from top internet companies, including NLP and CV offers. In China, people use the term "Doom of the Gods" to describe the extremely intense competition for algorithm positions during autumn recruitment, and many companies consider a master's degree as a basic requirement for becoming an algorithm engineer. However, I broke the norm and obtained several algorithm offers with my rich algorithm experience and excellent coding skills, including some sp offers and ssp offers. After graduation, I chose to join Megvii Research as a CV algorithm researcher.</p>
          <p>In the next decade, deep learning will trigger a significant increase in the human technology development curve speed, and acceleration. In fact, over the past decade, we have already glimpsed the preparatory period of this growth curve. When the first modern deep neural network, AlexNet, was born in 2012, people probably didn't expect that just ten years later, neural networks would be able to converse with humans, be your homework teacher, help you write code, and even replace traditional professions such as media workers and servers. Therefore, predicting the future of AI, even if done more wildly, is probably not something to be blamed.I like programming and AI. I think I will devote my life to the field of algorithm.</p>

          <p>Megvii operates the worldâ€™s largest computer vision research institute.Our research team has developed advanced algorithms that have laid the foundation for many of the world's cutting-edge AI applications.Megvii is one of the few companies in the world with a proprietary deep learning framework. MegEngine was officially made open source in 2020.</p>
          <p>At Megvii Research, my job is to participate in the development of advanced AI algorithm production systems - AI Service. With years of deep experience in computer vision, Megvii has accumulated a wealth of industry knowledge. From this experience, we abstracted the entire pipeline of algorithm production and attempted to standardize each step.</p>
          <p>To this end, we have launched the AI Service (AIS), an AI infrastructure designed to adapt to algorithm mass production. Based on the Megvii Brain++ system, AIS has built a zero-code, automated productivity tool platform that covers the entire algorithm production chain, including data processing, model training, performance analysis and tuning, inference deployment testing, and more. This platform allows practitioners without algorithm-related knowledge to independently complete algorithm production and iterative optimization tasks. AIS marks another leap forward for Megvii, making algorithm mass production a reality. Currently, the AIS platform can support over 100 types of business model training, with training completion possible in as little as 2 hours, and model accuracy metrics far surpassing the industry average.</p>
          <p>In addition to the development of the above system, I am also responsible for the research work on fast labeling algorithms. Specifically, for classification annotation, we use CLIP to extract image features. After a small amount of data is annotated, we compare the similarity of the clip features between the annotated and unannotated images, and then automatically label the unannotated images. For incorrectly labeled images, we use reinforcement learning methods to adjust the image features to improve the accuracy of intelligent annotation. This intelligent annotation method reduces labeling costs by 70%. For segmentation tasks, we have developed an advanced interactive segmentation algorithm based on VIT. With just a few clicks, annotators can complete the segmentation annotation of an object. Using traditional segmentation annotation methods, labeling an image with dense targets could take an hour, while our method only takes a minute.</p>

          <p>During my internship at the Tsinghua University's Autonomous Driving Laboratory, I worked on computer vision technology that involved PyTorch, deep learning, attention mechanisms, and multimodal fusion. Specifically, my project focused on fusing thermal and RGB images for object detection algorithms.Our insight was that each type of image carries unique information. For example, RGB images may contain more useful features under high visibility conditions, while thermal images may be more useful in low-light environments. Therefore, efficiently fusing the features from these two modalities could potentially improve the performance of object detection algorithms.</p>
          <p>To achieve this, we modified the input branch of the YOLOv5s baseline to create a dual-branch network that could simultaneously process both RGB and thermal images. We then used feature alignment and fusion methods, such as PLARD and deformable convolution, and included a branch for classifying images as daytime or nighttime to assist with training.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the new model increased the mean average precision (mAP) by two points, at the cost of a 25% increase in parameters (due to the need for multiple branches to handle multimodal information).Overall, my experience at the Tsinghua University's Autonomous Driving Laboratory allowed me to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques</p>

          <p>Nio Inc. is a Chinese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Shanghai, specializing in designing and developing electric vehicles. The company develops battery-swapping stations for its vehicles, as an alternative to conventional charging stations. The company has raised over $5 billions from investors. In 2021, Nio plans to expand to 25 different countries and regions by 2025.</p>
          <p>As a Perception Algorithm Intern at NIO Inc., I was responsible for implementing and optimizing 2D and 3D object detection algorithms for parking perception systems. My work involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to manage data selection, annotation, training, and testing to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the detection models. Specifically, I developed 3D object detection algorithms using point cloud data acquired from LiDAR sensors, and 2D object detection algorithms utilizing both anchor-based methods such as Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5, as well as anchor-free methods such as FCOS. My contributions throughout the pipeline included data preprocessing, algorithm design, testing, and optimization. Through this experience, I gained practical knowledge and skills in computer vision, machine learning, and software development.</p>
